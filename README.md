# Analysis on Sea Surface Temperature and Ice Concentration data

This project aims to analyze surface temperature data of oceans and ice concentration. The datasets used can be found at the following [link](https://psl.noaa.gov/data/gridded/data.noaa.oisst.v2.htmlconsumption). In the initial phase, an exploratory analysis of the datasets is conducted, highlighting the distributions of the two attributes through maps and time series. Subsequently, specific aspects of the two variables are investigated, as well as the relationship that exists between them.
